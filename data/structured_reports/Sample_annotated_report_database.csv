CLINICAL  HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old, right-handed woman with intractable complex partial epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Lyrica, Trileptal, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Clinical events are noted on February 3.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the waking pattern includes essentially continuous high amplitude arrhythmic delta from the left temporal region with almost continuous spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complexes.  This is seen in wakefulness and drowsiness. The overall background is slightly slow. Stage II sleep is characterized by spindle activity and ongoing spikes.   The epileptiform activity 1s essentially continuous in sleep as well.  Focal slowing isn't quite as prominent.
Practice push buttons are performed on the first day, but are not associated with clinical seizures.
Long-Term Monitoring, February 3, 2007 to February 4, 2007
INTRODUCTION: The patient is awake.  She reports one clinical seizure when out of bed walking with the nurse.
EVENT TIME 10:04:   The patient is out of bed.  She has prominent TIRDA from the left temporal region.  She crashes to the floor.  She just seems to drop abruptly.  With the onset of the abrupt drop, the EEG is completely obscured by muscle even with the use of filters.   The muscle activity starts at 10:04:11, and she seems to be doing something. Again, she just seems to fall down to the floor.  Her head droops forward.   The event seems to start at 10:04:14, and by the time the muscle artifact starts to abate, there is a rhythmic background picked up at 10:04:30, and that activity is actually maximum in the T1-T2 electrodes, but seems to be more remarkable from the right.  The patient is sitting at the edge of the camera screen with her head drooping forward.   The seizure seems to have ended on the left at 10:04:40, but continues on the right and then seems to be ending despite  a really  suboptimal  EEG.    There  seems  to be  a postictal  pattern  discernable despite  all the  artifacts  by  10:05:00.    Although this  was  an unusual  seizure  with  an unusual behavior pattern,  there is clearly a postictal  pattern noted and the EEG is quite remarkable  in  that  the  temporal  rhythmic  delta  is  not present  and  the  prominent  left temporal spikes  have also decreased.   Also of note, just prior to the seizure, she seemed to  have  less  in  the  way  of  the  extraordinarily  prominent  left temporal  sharp  waves, although  she  was  also  moving   around  quite  a  bit  more.    By  the  afternoon,  15:24, continuous left temporal spike and slow wave activity is noted, which seems to be asymptomatic and the patient is enjoying a magazine with this continuous ictal spiking.
Long-Term Monitoring, February 4, 2007 to February  5, 2007
DESCRIPTION  OF THE  RECORD:  EEG recording  demonstrates  nearly continuous left temporal spike and slow wave activity and rhythmic temporal slowing.   This is seen in wakefulness  and in stage II sleep with trains of temporal sharp waves.   There are rare portions of the record including  at 3:00 AM where the epileptiform activity abates.  The
EKG  lead  is lost  by  the morning  of the  51. The  remainder  of her  recording,  which concludes in the afternoon  of the 51 , continues to show focal slowing  a11d sharp waves, but no additional clinical seizures.  In addition, the pattern seen with the patient's clinical seizure was not seen at any other tin1e and despite the challenges of muscle artifact, there was very clear postictal slowing not seen at any other point in time.
HR: N/A.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This continuous video EEG monitoring is abnormal  due to:
1.   Left temporal spike and slow wave activity.
2.   TIRDA.
3.   An unusual complex partial seizure characterized  by the initial appearance of muscle artifact followed by rhythmic theta. The first clear scalp EEG correlate is late into the seizure m1d is on the right rather than the left.  The behavior was somewhat  unusual for a complex partial seizure  in that the patient dropped and then she is a bit wobbly rather than a typical seizure with automatisms and head turning.

Again, she just seems to fall down to the floor.  Her head droops forward.   The event seems to start at 10:04:14, and by the time the muscle artifact starts to abate, there is a rhythmic background picked up at 10:04:30, and that activity is actually maximum in the T1-T2 electrodes, but seems to be more remarkable from the right.  The patient is sitting at the edge of the camera screen with her head drooping forward.   The seizure seems to have ended on the left at 10:04:40, but continues on the right and then seems to be ending despite  a really  suboptimal  EEG.    There  seems  to be  a postictal  pattern  discernable despite  all the  artifacts  by  10:05:00.    Although this  was  an unusual  seizure  with  an unusual behavior pattern,  there is clearly a postictal  pattern noted and the EEG is quite remarkable  in  that  the  temporal  rhythmic  delta  is  not present  and  the  prominent  left temporal spikes  have also decreased.   Also of note, just prior to the seizure, she seemed to  have  less  in  the  way  of  the  extraordinarily  prominent  left temporal  sharp  waves, although  she  was  also  moving   around  quite  a  bit  more.    By  the  afternoon,  15:24, continuous left temporal spike and slow wave activity is noted, which seems to be asymptomatic and the patient is enjoying a magazine with this continuous ictal spiking.
Long-Term Monitoring, February 4, 2007 to February  5, 2007
DESCRIPTION  OF THE  RECORD:  EEG recording  demonstrates  nearly continuous left temporal spike and slow wave activity and rhythmic temporal slowing.   This is seen in wakefulness  and in stage II sleep with trains of temporal sharp waves.   There are rare portions of the record including  at 3:00 AM where the epileptiform activity abates.  The
h.h.EKG  lead  is lost  by  the morning  of the  51. The  remainder  of her  recording,  which concludes in the afternoon  of the 51 , continues to show focal slowing  a11d sharp waves, but no additional clinical seizures.  In addition, the pattern seen with the patient's clinical seizure was not seen at any other tin1e and despite the challenges of muscle artifact, there was very clear postictal slowing not seen at any other point in time.
HR: N/A.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This continuous video EEG monitoring is abnormal  due to:
1.   Left temporal spike and slow wave activity.
2.   TIRDA.
3.   An unusual complex partial seizure characterized  by the initial appearance of muscle artifact followed by rhythmic theta. The first clear scalp EEG correlate is late into the seizure m1d is on the right rather than the left.  The behavior was somewhat  unusual for a complex partial seizure  in that the patient dropped and then she is a bit wobbly rather than a typical seizure with automatisms and head turning.",,,

Patient presently has a left hemiparesis. He has been seizure-free for six years; total of 12 seizures described as focal left-sided jerking.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is awake, there is a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry. The left hemisphere is normal with alpha slow about 10 Hz. There are prominent sharp waves with a breach rhythm and delta and theta from right .
There are seven subclinical seizures, most are maximum in the right mid to anterior temporal region but others are at T4/C4.  Some have alpha or theta frequency activity.  Others have repetitive spike and slow wave activity, mostly seen in the T2-T4 region.
Photic stimulation is performed during one of his seizures and does not activate the record.  Seizures are seen in wakefulness and early drowsiness.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Seven focal seizures from the right temporal region without change in level of awareness with variability in terms of the type of epileptiform activity but with right centrotemporal localization.
Focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for epilepsy, as well as a structural abnormality and a craniotomy.  These results were discussed with the referring physician.",,,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the long-term monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage.  There is nearly continuous T4 spike wave activity. Soon after the recording begins, at 17:13, the patient has his first seizure.  It starts with his right hand rubbing his nose and staying there for about 10 to 15 seconds.  He then began to shake in his left hand, going up to his shoulder, then involving the right hand and both legs.  At that time, his face is turned to the right. Subsequently, his right hand stops shaking and only his left arm and right leg are still shaking.  At that time, his face turns to the left with both eyes deviated to the left. On the video, the rhythm of the left arm shaking is different from that of the right leg shaking.  It seems that the right leg shakes faster than the left arm for about 10 seconds and then the shaking is synchronized (left arm and right leg).  This spell lasts for about three minutes and the patient stopped seizing without a postictal phase and was moving spontaneously his left arm and could talk.  These types of spells occurred quite frequently, anywhere from several minutes to 30 minutes. During the spell, he can hold some objects in his right hand without dropping them.  After the seizure, the patient can put the objects by the bedside himself.  On the tracing, we counted a total number of spells to be 76. More than 40 occurred prior to midnight and about 30 after midnight.  Some high amplitude spike waves emanating from the C4 leads were seen in about half of the patientâs spells.  All of the patientâs spells had a similar course, lasting about 2 to 3 minutes. They started at the left arm, going to the right arm and then generalized tonic-clonic jerking. There was right shaking first and then asymmetric shaking of the left arm and right leg.  From the video, the patient seems to be unresponsive during his spells, but he responds normally immediately after the spells stop.
HR:  84 BPM.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Baclofen, Heparin, and Pantoprazole.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.  The patient is lethargic during the recording.  Prior to the start of the EEG recording, the patient was experiencing seizures
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the EEG begins, the patient is having a seizure characterized by right temporal continuous spike and waves and lasted for 20 seconds.  The second seizure was noted at 15:13 and also showed continuous right temporal spike and waves.  It ended at 15:16.  The third one was seen at 15:19 and ended at 15:23.  The fourth one occurred at 15:25 and ended at 15:27.  All the seizures were not associated the clinical changes in the patient, as seen in the video recording.  When the patient was not seizing, the background EEG was low voltage with a generous amount of beta activity.  Frequently, slow theta and delta activity was seen in the right temporal lobe. In sleep, while the patient was snoring, centrally predominant spindles were well correlated with the patient snoring.  Beta activity was more clearly evident in the left hemisphere.
HR:  80 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Recurrent seizures from the right temporal region.
Low voltage tracing with more beta activity in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG demonstrated four seizures without clinical seizure activity. Increasing beta activity in the left hemisphere may be due to medication such as Phenobarbital.  Decreased beta activity as well as slow activity and continuous spikes in the right
hemisphere suggests a pathological finding related to epilepsy. This tracing also suggests that the patient is in non-convulsive status-epilepticus.",,,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and light sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with theta activity and disorganized.  A rare, slow alpha rhythm of 7 Hz, 20 V is seen. Low voltage, frontocentral beta activity is also seen.  Soon after the EEG starts, bursts of 2 to 4 Hz frontally predominant sharp and slow wave complexes lasting for one to two seconds are seen.  In addition, frequent right focal spike and wave complexes are seen in the right hemisphere, mostly in the temporal region, but also in the occipital area.  This focal spike and wave activity occasionally generalized. Drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in the amplitude as well as a mixed frequency of activity, with bursts of frontally predominant 2 to 3 Hz sharp and slow wave activity. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  When the patient is aroused, she has some spastic facial movements, but no EEG correlates were recorded.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffusely slow and disorganized background.
Bursts of frontally predominant sharp and slow wave activity.
Focal spike and wave activity in the right temporal and occipital area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is consistent with a diffuse disorder of cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The epileptiform discharges found in the right hemisphere, as well as the frontally predominant sharp and slow waves supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient. This EEG pattern is usually seen in patients with refractory epilepsy.  The clinical differential should also include Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.",,,

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 50 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Occasional posterior slow waves of youth are identified.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing brief bursts of frontally predominant 3 to 6 Hz spike and wave activity.  As the recording continues, there is additional spike and slow wave activity at the end of hyperventilation and in the transition to drowsiness, which is again generally symmetric, frontally predominant, but is more in the category of 3 Hz with more after going slow waves.  Other features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha, an increase in background beta, and POSTS.  Additional spike wave discharges are seen, typically lasting less than a second as the patient makes the transition to sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.  Spike and slow wave activity is seen during and around the time of photic, but on only two occasions does it actually occur during photic at 15 Hz and 13 Hz.  The discharges occurring in photic stimulation are not prolonged and are less than one second in duration.  Given the prominent presence of brief spike and wave activity, it cannot be clearly assumed that photic stimulation accentuated the spike and wave activity.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant 3 to 6 Hz spike and wave activity, increasing in HV and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a primary generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  Although there is some wicket identified following hyperventilation, there are no definite focal spikes in this record.  Previous EEGs are not available for comparison.",,,

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Keppra, and Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and briefly asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is fairly well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 50 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Occasionally, initial subtle left temporal slowing is seen, which is evident more in  hyperventilation.   Post-hyperventilation, the left temporal slowing demonstrates more rhythmically.  The background seems to be generally ""spiky"" with a spiky appearance of vertex waves. During the course of the record, especially in drowsiness, there are occasional sharply contoured delta and a few sharp waves seen from the left temporal region, maximum at T5.  Stage II  sleep is achieved briefly and characterized by vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS. Photic stimulation elicits a symmetric driving response.
HR.:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Left temporal focal slowing.
2.   Left temporal sharp waves and sharply contoured delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This tracing supports a focal or localization-related mechanism for the patient's epilepsy.  Compared to previous records, there appears to be fewer epileptic features, however, this record's poor technical quality has several artifacts.",,,

INTRODUCTION:  This is a continuation of the day 3 and 4 report on this patient for the dates 03/14/2012 to 03/16/2012.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Day 3:  At the onset of day 3, there is frequent rhythmic runs of sharp waves seen at F7, T1 and at times at T5 that appear to come and go but have no clear evolution.  However, on 03/15 in the morning at 9:30 a.m., the patient appears to suddenly stop talking on the phone, put herself on the side of her left chest and started rubbing her shirt with her right hand.  The nurses at the bedside started asking her questions, and she could not answer.  Then she started staring at the nurse and exhibiting mouth movements while she continued to rub her chest with her hand.  Afterwards, about 20 seconds later, she started rubbing her chest with her left hand and continued to __________with the left hand.  This continues until the seizure and the left hand movement stops seconds later, and then she just stares and remains unresponsive.  This behavior then stops as the seizure stops.  About 2 minutes and 40 seconds after the seizure, the behavior stops and the seizure ends.  During this time, the EEG reveals at about almost 50 seconds after the clinical onset of the seizure there appears to be an evolving T5 discharge which then appears to increase in frequency from 2 to 4 Hz to 6 Hz and moves more anteriorly, then slowing down before stopping at the end of the seizure.  End of day 3.
Day 4:  During day 4, there are multiple nonconvulsive seizures.  The first one is seen at 6:30 p.m. lasting about 4 minutes where the patient is lying in bed and appears to exhibit no movements.  Meanwhile, there is a rhythmic discharge in the left anterior temporal region at F7-T1 that increases and slows down in rhythmicity but continues throughout the recording, at times with larger and smaller superimposed sharp waves.  The next nonconvulsive electrical seizure occurred at 11:31 p.m.  This one appears to begin at T5 and appears to slowly evolve and move more anteriorly to F7-T1.  During it, the patient appears to move but does not clearly appear to exhibit a clinical correlate.  The event ends about 1 minute and 50 seconds later.  End of seizures day 4.

However, on 03/15 in the morning at 9:30 a.m., the patient appears to suddenly stop talking on the phone, put herself on the side of her left chest and started rubbing her shirt with her right hand.  The nurses at the bedside started asking her questions, and she could not answer.  Then she started staring at the nurse and exhibiting mouth movements while she continued to rub her chest with her hand.  Afterwards, about 20 seconds later, she started rubbing her chest with her left hand and continued to __________with the left hand.  This continues until the seizure and the left hand movement stops seconds later, and then she just stares and remains unresponsive.  This behavior then stops as the seizure stops.  About 2 minutes and 40 seconds after the seizure, the behavior stops and the seizure ends.  During this time, the EEG reveals at about almost 50 seconds after the clinical onset of the seizure there appears to be an evolving T5 discharge which then appears to increase in frequency from 2 to 4 Hz to 6 Hz and moves more anteriorly, then slowing down before stopping at the end of the seizure.  End of day 3.
Day 4:  During day 4, there are multiple nonconvulsive seizures.  The first one is seen at 6:30 p.m. lasting about 4 minutes where the patient is lying in bed and appears to exhibit no movements.  Meanwhile, there is a rhythmic discharge in the left anterior temporal region at F7-T1 that increases and slows down in rhythmicity but continues throughout the recording, at times with larger and smaller superimposed sharp waves.  The next nonconvulsive electrical seizure occurred at 11:31 p.m.  This one appears to begin at T5 and appears to slowly evolve and move more anteriorly to F7-T1.  During it, the patient appears to move but does not clearly appear to exhibit a clinical correlate.  The event ends about 1 minute and 50 seconds later.  End of seizures day 4.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Norvasc, Simvastatin, Keppra, ASA, Levetiracetam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
The patient was instructed that she might have one of her typical events during her EEG, but that was okay, it would be a safe place.  She was able to do so.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a low voltage pattern with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Within minutes of the EEG the patient has one of her typical spells, slamming her body forwards and backwards in the chair.  When asked to relax she is able to do so.
The first events begins at 9:51:33 and lasts about 40 seconds.  Following this she is awake, alert, able to follow commands with a well defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm and no postictal slowing.
A second event occurs at 9:57, again lasting less than a minute.  The patient is consolable and in fact she is able to stop the motor activity when the technologist comes to her aid.  Again, no postictal features are noted.
A third event occurs at 10:03 and again 10:06, at that point the patient is holding onto the tech to stop the behaviors.  She seems to be suffering anguish as she puts her hands to her eyes and looks away from the camera.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR:    60-80 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Multiple behavioral spells with bilateral rocking, particularly of the truncal muscles without EEG change.
Absence of postictal slowing.
An otherwise normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These features are relative classic examples of nonepileptic seizures.  No epileptiform features were noted.",,,

The patient was admitted with recurrent seizures, and required intubation.  History of diabetes, GERD, hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, acyclovir, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixed frequency pattern with delta activity.  There is some evidence of stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindle.  This is a dynamic pattern with intermittent bursts of higher amplitudes, 1-2 Hz delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in higher amplitude delta.
Heart rate 98 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Medications, a CNS infection, or other diffuse disturbances could also produce this pattern.  There were no sharp waves or periodic complexes to suggest a herpes encephalitis.",,,
